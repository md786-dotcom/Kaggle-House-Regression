## üèÜ Competition Performance

**Current Ranking: 519 / 4,677** (Top 11.1%) as of July 24, 2025, 4:30 PM AEST

A comprehensive solution for predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and ensemble methods.

üöÄ **[Live Demo on Streamlit](https://kaggle-house-regression-lmt7fphzvhzj7t7zcqvtqy.streamlit.app/)** - Interactive demonstration of the techniques and models used

## üìä Project Overview

This project tackles the Kaggle House Prices competition, which challenges participants to predict the final sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. With 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes, this competition provides an excellent opportunity to showcase advanced regression techniques and feature engineering skills.

### Key Achievements
- **Top 11.1% ranking** among 4,677 participants
- Implemented multiple advanced regression models including XGBoost, LightGBM, and Kernel Ridge
- Extensive feature engineering creating 20+ new features
- Robust preprocessing pipeline handling missing values and outliers
- Ensemble approach combining 8 different models with optimized weights

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Highlights

1. **Total Square Footage**: Combines basement, first floor, and second floor areas
2. **Quality Interactions**: Multiplies quality and condition ratings
3. **Neighborhood Price Encoding**: Uses median prices from training data
4. **Age Features**: Both absolute age and time since remodeling
5. **Room Ratios**: Bedrooms per room, bathrooms per bedroom

### Handling Missing Values

- **"None" Features**: PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, Fence (missing = no feature)
- **Zero Features**: Garage and basement measurements (missing = no garage/basement)
- **Neighborhood-based**: LotFrontage imputed by neighborhood median
- **Mode Imputation**: Remaining categorical features

### Model Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal parameters
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust evaluation
- **Ensemble Weights**: Optimized based on CV performance
- **Log Transformation**: Target variable and skewed features

## üìä Visualizations

The project includes visualization of:
- Target variable distribution (normal vs log-transformed)
- Feature correlations with sale price
- Model performance comparisons
- Prediction distributions
